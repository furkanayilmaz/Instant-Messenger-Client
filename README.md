It is a simple Chatting application for those who is looking for a secure chat. 

This application work on any platform Linux, Distors, MacOS, and Windows. It does not require anything installed other then Java latest version. 

## How it works
To connect to someone you will need to run the client side of this code. 
You can find that here (https://github.com/furkanayilmaz/Instant-Messenger)

When connecting you will need IP address. Enter the IP address to the client side (ClientRunner.java).
When entering the IP address make sure you enter it in thos format.
("xx.xxx.x.x")

If you are expecting someone to connect to you then you don't need to run the client side.

For Client Connection: SERVER - END
For People Who is Connected: CLIENT - END
